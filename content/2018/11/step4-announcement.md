Greetings all,

We're very happy to announce that the Stevens Cyber Defense Team has met all the
requirements to be considered a Step 4 Registered Student Organization (RSO)
within Stevens! This means that we are a probationary RSO, and are given a
budget and several other perks.

That's not important to everyone else - what is important is that we now have
the capability to run bigger and better meetings, and run them more often. Some
ideas we have for events include:

* CTF all-nighters / CTF weekends
* Vuln presentations
* Source code readings
* Workshops run by alumni in industry
* Cyberpunk (or any other) movie nights
* ... and more!

If you have ideas for things you want to see, feel free to email us at
stevens.scdt [at] gmail.com.
